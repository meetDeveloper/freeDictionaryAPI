# Free Dictionary API

There was no free Dictionary API on the web when I wanted one for my friend, so I created one.

## Important Note
The API usage has been ramping up rapidly, making it difficult for me to keep the server running due to increased AWS costs.

Your support directly helps the development of Dictionary API and keeps the server running.

## Getting Started

### Usage 

The basic syntax of a URL request to the API is shown below:

`https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/<--version-->/entries/en/<--word-->`

As an example, to get definition of English word **hello** using _v2_, you can send request to

`https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/hello` and the result returned will be:

```json
[
  {
    "word": "hello",
    "phonetic": "həˈləʊ",
    "phonetics": [
      {
        "text": "həˈləʊ",
        "audio": "//ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20200429/hello--_gb_1.mp3"
      },
      {
        "text": "hɛˈləʊ"
      }
    ],
    "origin": "early 19th century: variant of earlier hollo ; related to holla.",
    "meanings": [
      {
        "partOfSpeech": "exclamation",
        "definitions": [
          {
            "definition": "used as a greeting or to begin a phone conversation.",
            "example": "hello there, Katie!",
            "synonyms": [],
            "antonyms": []
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "partOfSpeech": "noun",
        "definitions": [
          {
            "definition": "an utterance of ‘hello’; a greeting.",
            "example": "she was getting polite nods and hellos from people",
            "synonyms": [],
            "antonyms": []
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "partOfSpeech": "verb",
        "definitions": [
          {
            "definition": "say or shout ‘hello’.",
            "example": "I pressed the phone button and helloed",
            "synonyms": [],
            "antonyms": []
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Regarding V1 Version
The API earlier used to send response as shown below, but this structure of response was found out to be difficult to work with (you can take a look at these tickets [#32](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI/issues/32) and [#4](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI/issues/4)), based on feedback in these tickets I have updated the API to _v2_ version. But _v1_ version will always be supported for backward compatibility.

```json
[
  {
    "word": "hello",
    "phonetic": "həˈləʊ",
    "phonetics": [
      {
        "text": "həˈləʊ",
        "audio": "//ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20200429/hello--_gb_1.mp3"
      },
      {
        "text": "hɛˈləʊ"
      }
    ],
    "origin": "early 19th century: variant of earlier hollo ; related to holla.",
    "meaning": {
      "exclamation": [
        {
          "definition": "used as a greeting or to begin a phone conversation.",
          "example": "hello there, Katie!",
          "synonyms": [],
          "antonyms": []
        }
      ],
      "noun": [
        {
          "definition": "an utterance of ‘hello’; a greeting.",
          "example": "she was getting polite nods and hellos from people",
          "synonyms": [],
          "antonyms": []
        }
      ],
      "verb": [
        {
          "definition": "say or shout ‘hello’.",
          "example": "I pressed the phone button and helloed",
          "synonyms": [],
          "antonyms": []
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

## Support Me
This Dictionary API was initially created as an API that could be used by my friend for his project. I did not in my wildest dream thought that this API will become so popular, in few months this API took off and many people started to use it, initially I was able to manage the server costs but as number of requests started increasing, so did the server costs. Currently API has more than 10 million requests per month and to keep it running I need support of the community. I have planned few things in near future that will bring the cost down, but that will take some time. 

Kindly help me keep running and developing this API. Thanks a lot for using my API, it feels good when your creation help other create their own projects.
